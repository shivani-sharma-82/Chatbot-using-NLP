# Chatbot-using-NLP
<h2>Chatbot using NLTK and NLP in Python and streamlit</h2>
This chatbot is built that can understand and respond to user input based on intents. The chatbot was trained using NLP and Logistic Regression, and the interface was built using Streamlit. This project can be extended by adding more data, using more sophisticated NLP techniques, deep learning algorithms.
<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used in this project is a collection of labelled intents and entities. The data is stored in a list.

Intents: The intent of the user input (e.g. "greeting", "budget", "about")
Entities: The entities extracted from user input (e.g. "Hi", "How do I create a budget?", "What is your purpose?")
Text: The user input text.
<h2>Streamlit Chatbot Interface</h2>
The chatbot interface is built using Streamlit. The interface includes a text input box for users to input their text and a chat window to display the chatbot's responses. The interface uses the trained model to generate responses to user input.
